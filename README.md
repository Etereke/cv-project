# cv-project

My first React App, made as an exercise for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-cv-application).

The looks of the webpage was secondary, the main point of the exercise was to practice basic React concepts like components, state, props...

This branch is a different version that was implemented with function components, instead of class components. The exercise here was to rewrite the whole project to function components, in order to practice how the two types of component relate to each other.
